# Warsztaty_4

## Description
Warsztaty_4 is a project which was created during Coders Lab lessons. 
It mainly uses AJAX to manage dates from the server, which was provided by school. 
Server stores information about books. In his functionality is similar to a library. 
Our task was to create the web page which allows client to do following action:
 * GET /books/ - takes a list of all books
 * POST /books/ - put new book into library based on data taken from form
 * GET /books/{id} - take information about the book with given id
 * PUT /books/{id} - change information about the book with given id
 * DELETE /books/{id} - delete the book with given id from the database
